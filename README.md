VTE based, highly customizable terminal emulator. Written by Wen-Yen Chuang <caleb AT calno DOT com>

It supports almost everything VTE pro vides. It also supports tabs, 
automatic hiding of the tab bar, and the ability to switch encoding at runtime. 
       
Configuration is done by editing the source code, especially src/config.h, and recompiling.

Some options can be changed via hotkeys or a menu, e.g. font size or encodings for each tab.
